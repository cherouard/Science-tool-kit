General goal:
We want to create tools/objects to teach science in a playful and intuitive way.
The project will consist in creating a kit of several objects for the free experimentation and a manual for the academic framework.
We want to keep these object as cheap and simple as possible to diffuse them and create an open source manual that will accompany the project and will contain all the necessary information for the creation of the kit.



Steps:
- Clearly define the concept we want to teach, how, and to whom.
- Design the object.
- Create a prototype.
- Design pedagogical activities.
- Test it.

First project: Equilicool 
  Website: https://equilicool.wordpress.com/equilicool/
  Current participants:
    - Anat (Crafting of the object, website)
    - Cl√©ment (Redaction of the manual, scientific calculus)
We want to explain physical laws that are involved in balance (gravity forces, center of gravity...)
We want to design and manufacture with a laser cutter a kind of hanger in several sizes (meaning several weights).
The idea is to invite child to expresse their idea on the balancing of this object when you use different mass.
So we want to put some "clues" on the object (like gradution on the hanger).
